# INSTALLATION (backup)

This file was merged into README.md. The detailed installation steps (dependency checks, `python utils/dependency_manager.py setup`, ffmpeg and Node.js setup) are now present in the consolidated README.

If you need the previous standalone installation guide restored, tell me and I will restore a fuller copy from version control or add missing details here.
