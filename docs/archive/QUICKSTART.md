# QUICKSTART (backup)

Quick start steps were merged into README.md under "Quick Start". Basic commands:

```bash
python utils/dependency_manager.py setup
python api_server.py
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

If you want the original expanded quickstart restored, I can fetch it from version control and place it here.
